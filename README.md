# ml

## Overview

This is a collection of common machine learning algorithms written from scratch, or mostly scratch. Many were projects for school or began as a school project and were modified to what I have here, adding some things. Each has a brief explanation as to how the math works and some other useful notes. This is really for my own personal use, to refresh my memory on specific details, and recall the math as its easy to forget aspects of these things. If someone finds it useful that's pretty cool too.

## How to use

Each major type of ML has its own directory, so finding a specific algorithm starts with what kind of learning it relates to, unsupervised, supervised, or reinforcement learning. Each notebook either has synthetic data created in the notebook or has a link to the data source if you want to download it. A few notebooks do not have the data available as it isn't mine to share. Each notebook can be run on its own as long as you have the correct libaries installed. For most of them this is just the python standard library, numpy, and matplotlib.
